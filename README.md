# satellite-loc-demo1

Creating a VPC to use for satellite location demos

**ARCHITECTURE**

The diagram shows the target architecture for this cheat sheet. We will create:

one virtual private cloud (VPC)
three virtual server instances (VSI)
one security group with a security group access control rule
three subnets
one floating IP for each vsi (to access the virtual server instance)
